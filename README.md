## Identifying human eye diseases from retinal OTC images

In this project, we developed and evaluated four different models for the classification of OCT images. Each model was designed with specific modifications to explore different strategies in addressing class imbalance and leveraging pre-trained weights. The selected architecture was the ResNet50V2, which is a widely used deep learning architecture. In files `DL_project_part1.ipynb' and `DL_project_part2.ipynb' we present the different models.
